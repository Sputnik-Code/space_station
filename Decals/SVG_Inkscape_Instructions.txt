File -> Import (select PNG image)

png bitmap image import options -> change image rendering mode to "smooth", click ok

top menu, click path -> "trace bitmap"

select "brightness cutoff" and set to 0.990, click ok (dialogue box doesnt go away, have to close it)

now delete the PNG imported image (the one which looks pixelated when you zoom in)

save as SVG? might set the stroke to off (under fill/stroke options)
