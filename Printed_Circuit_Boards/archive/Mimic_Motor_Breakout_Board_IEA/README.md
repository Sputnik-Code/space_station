The motor breakout board gets installed in the Integrated Equipment Assembly (IEA) location on the outboard truss. The function of this board is to route the signals from the slip ring (which come from the motor controller which go up through the HDMI cable) to the Beta Gimbal Assembly (BGA) motors to directly move the solar arrays. 

The board also has places for 6 neopixel LEDs which can display the ISS battery charge status. The Neopixels are 100% not required for functionality of the board. They are somewhat difficult to install to feel free to skip them.
