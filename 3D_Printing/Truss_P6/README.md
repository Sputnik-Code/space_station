### This print is probably the most difficult print in the whole project. During post-processing removal of support material it is very easy to break the print. If you want to print the low fidelity truss, those files are located [here](https://github.com/ISS-Mimic/Mimic/tree/main/3D_Printing/Truss_S6). In the low fidelity build, P6 and S6 are the exact same model, however in the high fidelity build there are a few differences.
