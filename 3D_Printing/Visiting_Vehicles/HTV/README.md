# HTV
HTV (H-II Transfer Vehicle - aka Kounotori) is the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)'s uncrewed cargo resupply vehicle. The current HTV has completed all of its deliveries to the ISS but a new version HTV-X is in development. The HTV carried an External Pallet (EP) that was used to bring cargo to the external facilities on the ISS.

So the vehicle this model represents will not be visiting the ISS anymore, however it is still an excellent model and was a very important vehicle for the ISS program so you can print it if you wish.

The HiFi HTV/EP models were created by the Canadian Space Agency and modified for use on MIMIC - the original files can be found here: https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/multimedia/search/image/watch/10189 - thanks Canada!
